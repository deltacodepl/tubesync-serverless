# Terraform & AWS SAM integration example

This repo demonstrates how you can integrate Terraform infrastructure deployment with an [AWS SAM Application](https://github.com/rpstreef/aws-sam-node-example/). 

The main reasons for this combination:

- AWS SAM ease of local development and testing with official AWS developed Docker containers for AWS Lambda, API Gateway and DynamoDB.
- AWS SAM concept of a Serverless Application that can be shared in their repository
- AWS SAM and AWS CodeDeploy integration, allows for Blue/Green deployments with AWS CloudWatch alarms and deployment phase monitoring for the best deployment experience and reliability.
- Terraform use of a modular approach resulting in reusable code (DRY). CloudFormation relies on hard to maintain includes or simply copy/paste of code.
- Terraform wide range of AWS services support through AWS CLI as API. In some cases AWS CLI (and by extension, Terraform) supports certain AWS Services earlier than CloudFormation.

# Get started

## The essentials

- Download Terraform v0.12.x [here](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html)
- You will need Node v12.x from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- Git, to clone this Repo, from [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- Create a free AWS account (requires credit card) [here](https://aws.amazon.com/)
- Finally, download the [AWS CLI tool](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) 
- Setup your AWS local profile, see [this](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-profiles.html) guide how it's done.
- Manually setup an AWS S3 Bucket for Terraform state storage.

## How to get it running

If you meet all the pre-requisites, do the following

- In your AWS development account create the S3 bucket for your Terraform state files.
  - Optionally, encrypt the S3 bucket and enable versioning such that you can do a rollback.
- ``git clone`` this repo.
- Change your AWS credentials profile name in these files: 
  - ``./env/dev/remote-backend.tf``
  - ``./env/dev/dev.tfvars``
- Run ``npm install`` and then execute ``npm run dev-init ``, this will:
  - Initialize the Terraform project for the 'dev' environment, and synchronize the state with the cloud stored .tfstate file (when present).
  - If you run it a second time, it will fail on the workspace creation, this is not an issue (the workspace already exists)
- Run ``npm run dev-infra`` to prepare the deployment to your AWS account.
  - Note: this [repo](https://github.com/rpstreef/aws-sam-node-example/) contains the AWS SAM template, AWS Lambda NodeJS source code, and the OpenAPI specification. These will automatically get deployed by AWS CodePipeline. But it requires a few steps after that to "connect" Terraform with AWS SAM.
  - Confirm with ``yes`` to deploy, anything else will cancel the deployment
  - The deployment will have errors; ``Error adding new Lambda Permission``, this is normal. It's because AWS SAM hasn't deployed the Lambda functions yet.
- Run `dev-output-sam` to get a status update on the AWS SAM deployment in property ``StackStatus``
  - When the deployment is finished, we can see the Stack output in the property ``Outputs``, match that with the ``dev.tfvars`` file.
- Run ``dev-infra`` again after updating the ``dev.tfvars`` with the correct input
  - Make sure the property ``Parameters`` corresponds with the output of Terraform. If it isn't the case update the ``configuration.json`` file in the AWS SAM example [repo](https://github.com/rpstreef/aws-sam-node-example/).
- Redeploy Terraform with ``dev-infra``, this will add the AWS Lambda execution permissions to the API Gateway endpoints.

That's all done!

## Running costs

There are no costs associated with deploying any of this on AWS, there is [Free Tier](https://aws.amazon.com/free) coverage for limited free use.

The following services are deployed with Terraform;
- AWS Cognito
- AWS IAM
- AWS CloudWatch Alarms, costs will be incurred for enabling Detailed Monitoring for API Gateway (!)
- AWS CodePipeline, CodeBuild, and CodeDeploy with Github as source repository. There's a free tier for:
  - [CodeBuild](https://aws.amazon.com/codebuild/pricing/), 100 build minutes of ```build.general1.small``` per month.
  - [AWS CodePipeline](https://aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/pricing/): 1 free pipeline active per month. New pipeline's free for the first 30 days.# tubesync
